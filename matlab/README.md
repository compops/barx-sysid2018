# Matlab code

## Installation
This code was developed and run using MATLAB 2017a.

## Reproducing the results in the paper
The scripts in this directory generates data for illustrations 1 and 2 as well as estimating the ARX model using the approach discussed in the paper. The output is saved in `results/example1` and `results/example2`. The code should be self explanatory, see README.md in `python/` for more information.
